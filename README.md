# OIBSIP--LandingPage
I have recently created a Zomato-inspired landing webpage using only HTML and CSS. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in incorporating various design elements such as dividing sections, managing padding and margins, arranging page items, and including headers and footers. These skills have allowed me to enhance the webpage's effectiveness and make it visually impressive. I'm excited to share this project on GitHub to showcase my progress and contribute to the web development community.
