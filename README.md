# OIBSIP--LandingPage
I've created a Zomato landing webpage using only HTML and CSS. During this project, I gained valuable experience in structuring the page with distinct sections, fine-tuning layout elements such as padding and margins, organizing content, and implementing headers and footers to enhance the overall visual appeal and user experience.
